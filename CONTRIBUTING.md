## Swift Style Guide

### Code Formatting

- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Keep lines under 120 characters when possible
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Follow SwiftUI conventions

### SwiftUI Best Practices

- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Keep views small and focused
- Use `@State` for local state only
- Extract complex views into separate structs
- Use preview providers for all views

### Example

```swift
struct CustomButton: View {
    let title: String
    let action: () -> Void
    
    var body: some View {
        Button(action: action) {
            Text(title)
                .font(.headline)
                .foregroundColor(.white)
                .padding()
                .background(Color.blue)
                .cornerRadius(8)
        }
    }
}
```

## Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
